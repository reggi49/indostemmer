Indostemmer is C# Indonesian Stemming algorithm that use to transform a word into it basic form. In researches about Text Processing, Data Mining, Knowledge Data Discovery and about text in general, the task of processing derivative word into stem word is very important, because processing non-stem word can cause mistakes and deviations in the result. In this research, the stemming process is done by a stemmer made based on a rulested in the form of an XML (Extensible Markup Language) file in hope that the ruleset is easily customized. The stemmer itself is a parser using the FSA (Finite State Automata) principle, due to the fact that Indonesian language structure might contain double prefix or suffix. There are three evaluations done in this research. The first evaluation results in 84.33 % accuracy from 25269 words being tested. The second evaluation is an improvement from the first evaluation especially on the ruleset structures, resulting in 87.22% accuracy. The third evaluation is focused on adding information into the ruleset,resulting in 90.25% accuracy from 25269 words being tested.
